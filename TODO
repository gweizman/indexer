- Figure out the correct way to deal with errors (log.Fatal seems wrong, ignoring seems worse?)
- Make sure tika and cassandra are functional before setting everything up
- Add pre-calculated alternate versions
    - Lexed using Pygments
    - Translated using Tika or http://rtg.isi.edu/many-eng/
- Build a GUI obviously
    - Full text search with regex, great ideas @ https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt/blob/master/doc/design.md
- Pygments, Tika, etc., should be wrapped with gRPC and treated like micro-services instead of running a binary for each
