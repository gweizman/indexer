- Find a name for the project
- Figure out the correct way to deal with errors (log.Fatal seems wrong, ignoring seems worse?)
- Also save original file version (pre-tika) to some kind of object storage for displaying (instead of displaying the parsed version from the db)
    - Actualy just saving tika output for now. Add a parser for other binary files (strings.exe maybe?)
- Add pre-calculated alternate versions
    - Lexed using Pygments - currently doing on-the-fly in GUI, can pre-calculate
    - Translated using Tika or http://rtg.isi.edu/many-eng/
- Build a GUI obviously
- Pygments, Tika, etc., should be wrapped with gRPC and treated like micro-services instead of running a binary for each
- Add volumes to docker-compose (although having the data erase itself is good for now)
- Make sure project names can't contain commas
- Pass a context to chi so db isn't made for every request
- Search is 100% broken. Results are never what I expect them to be.
- Change most of these to github issues
- Change favicon
- Use CSS variables
